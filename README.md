## Summary 

With the opioid crisis being an important health, economic and societal burden for the US, this project analyzes the effectiveness of a series of policies that intended to control the opioid crisis between 2005 and 2015. This project analyzes: <br>
(1) opioid availability for prescriptions, and 
(2) mortality rates 
in 3 states: Texas, Washington, and Florida, which had policy interventions designed to limit the over-prescription of opioids between 2005 and 2015. 
To analyze the effect of the policies, a Pre-Post Comparison and a Difference-in-Difference causal inference techniques are evaluated.

# Findings

Our findings suggest that Florida’s opioid control policy is likely the most effective, compared to the policies studied in Texas and Washington. While the national overdose trend and Florida’s trend coincided before 2010, after the implementation of Operation Pill Nation there was a sharp decline in the mortality rate. The level of opiate shipments also had a sharp decline, while the trends in the control states of Kentucky, North Carolina, and Georgia remained stagnant.
The success seen by Florida was achieved to a lesser extent in Washington and Texas. 
The data from Florida suggests that limiting access to opiates decreases the likelihood of overdose. It also suggests that stricter policies may lead to stronger decline. That being said, there are additional factors that were not considered in our analysis that may be influencing the trends seen in our different treatment states. For example, Texas saw a very slow rate of decline for its opiate mortality rates following 2007. Opiates can also be found in the form of recreational drugs such as heroin or fentanyl. It has been estimated that over 90 percent of the heroin in the United States comes from Mexico, so it stands to reason that a border state, like Texas, may have more access to these recreational opiates. 
Access to healthcare was not considered in this analysis but may give more insight into the nature of addiction in certain areas. Not all overdoses are fatal, some may result in hospitalizations instead.
