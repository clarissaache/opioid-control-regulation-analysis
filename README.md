## Summary 

National survey estimates indicate that in 2018 nearly 10 million people misused prescription opioids, approximately 800,000 used heroin, and 2 million people had an opioid use disorder(OUD). Additionally, initial evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic may have increased opioid misuse and mortality. Preliminary data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates overdose deaths rose 28.5% nationally in 2020, and 38.5% in Minnesota. In response to the ongoing crisis, state governments have enacted a broad array of policies. With the opioid crisis being an important health, economic and societal burden for the US, this project analyzes the effectiveness of policies that intended to control the opioid epidemic Three policies analyzed here were enacted in Florida in 2010, Texas in 2007, and Washington in 2012. To analyse the effect of the policy interventions, a \textit{Pre-Post Comparison} and a \textit{Difference-in-Diffrence} quasi-experimental design are specified. Findings indicate the success of the policies enforced in Florida in altering the rate of increase for both prescription opioid shipments and opioid mortality. Florida's opioid-related overdose mortality rate became lower than the national average, despite being slightly above in the years before 2010. The success seen by Florida was achieved to a lesser extent in Washington and Texas.
